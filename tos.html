            CHAKADEALS TERMS OF SERVICE
        </h1>
        <p class="Gotham-Light text-sm text-justify leading-7">
            This page sets out the terms for the use of the Site offered by Unchained Warrior Limited trading with the brand name “ChakaDeals” and the Services we offer.
        </p>
        <p class="Gotham-Light text-sm leading-9 text-justify w-full">
            <p class="text-justify text-sm Gotham-Light font-bold">
            1. BASICS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THESE TERMS OF USE </p><br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            1.1. What this document is and who we are: You are reading a legal document which is the
            agreement between you, the Customer (whom we refer to as "you", "your" or the
            "Customer" in this document) and us. You are agreeing to the terms of use that appear
            below, all of which are called the “Agreement”. We are ChakaDeals and we are the operator
            of this Site, and provider of a range of services related to the Site. Unchained Warrior
            Limited (the parent company) is a company registered in England and Wales with our
            registered office at 7 Bell Yard, London, WC2A 2JR, United Kingdom. Our company number is
            09988854. We refer to ourselves as "ChakaDeals", "we", "us" or "our" in this document, and
            we refer to us and any other companies of the Unchained Warrior group of companies,
            including our affiliates, parents and subsidiaries, as the “ChakaDeals”. ChakaDeals may
            assume all contracts, rights, obligations and liabilities under these Terms of Use published
            on this website. </p><br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            1.2. What we do: We provide a platform (including this Site, mobile applications, etc.) where
            we, our local affiliates and other sellers (collectively, “Sellers”) can list offers for Vouchers,
            deals, goods, getaways and other products (collectively, “Items”). As a platform provider, we
            help facilitate transactions for Items on our platform. We are never a buyer and usually not
            the Seller; we provide a venue for Sellers and you to negotiate and complete transactions.
            This means that in addition to this Agreement, you will have other contractual relationships
            with different legal entities when you interact with the Site.</p>  <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            1.3. What are all the legal relationships: Whatever Item you purchase via the Site will be
            subject to the terms and conditions of that Seller. Since ChakaDeals is not usually a Seller,
            this means that your contract of sale will most likely be with a different legal entity. But
            please note that any contracts formed at the completion of a sale for Items are solely
            between you and the Seller (and not ChakaDeals, unless ChakaDeals is the seller). The Seller
            is responsible for the sale and for dealing with any claims or any other issue arising out of or
            in connection with the contract between you and the Seller. Please also note that in respect
            of purchases of a Voucher, in addition to the contract of sale you will have with the Seller of
            the Voucher, there will also be a contract between you and the business that provides the
            Products when you redeem your Voucher with that business (the “Merchant”). In respect of
            any Vouchers, neither we nor any Seller assumes responsibility for any contracts regarding
            the redemption of your Voucher with a Merchant. Finally, please understand that we are
            never the Seller's or Merchant’s agent. </p><br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            1.4. What we also do: We may provide a forum to submit or post User Content, as well as
            send newsletters and other communications to you. To send emails to you, we need to
            know a little bit about you. Look at our data collection and processing practices in
            our Privacy Statement for details.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">

            Site, via scraping, spidering or otherwise. As an exception, revocable at any time by us,
            operators of public search engines may use spiders to copy materials from the Site for the

            indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            1.6. Limited License: Notwithstanding any other term of these Terms of Use, you shall be

            code that is optimized for Accelerated Mobile Pages) and nothing in these Terms of Use
            shall act as an express or implied waiver of any of ChakaDeals's rights, or its ability to

            1.8. Definitions: In this Agreement, we use various defined terms. You will know they are
            defined because they begin with a capital letter. These are all defined within or at the end of
            this Agreement in section 13). </p> <br>
            2. REGISTERING WITH US AND YOUR ACCOUNT <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.1. Why Register: Depending on the functionality of our Site at any time, you may or may
            not need to Register to use much of its functionality or to access many of our Services.
            However, you must Register to make a purchase unless you choose to use the guest
            checkout feature on the Site. If you make a purchase using the guest checkout and you do
            not already have an Account with us, we will create an Account for you based on the
            information provided to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your name, address,
            email address, and other transaction information). You may later claim this Account by
            creating a password for the Account. Your Account will provide you with easy access to print
            your Voucher, view your past purchases, store any ChakaDeals credit for you and modify
            your preferences. We reserve the right to decline a new Registration or to cancel an Account
            at any time. You Register with us, so you don’t have to re-enter your information every time
            you buy something. </p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.2. How to Register: To Register you need to supply us with your name, postcode, email
            address, phone number and possibly some other personal information.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.3. Passwords: During Registration, you will also need to supply us with your password. You
            must keep the password confidential and immediately notify us if any unauthorized third
            party becomes aware of that password or if there is any unauthorized use of your email
            address or any breach of security known to you. You agree that we are not responsible or
            liable if a person to whom your password is disclosed uses (and/or transacts via) ourServices and Site.
            Please note that you are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the
            confidentiality of your password.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.4. Valid email addresses: All Accounts must be Registered with a valid personal email
            address that you access regularly. Any Accounts which have been Registered with someone
            else’s email address or with temporary email addresses may be closed without notice. We
            may require users to re-validate their Accounts if we believe they have been using an invalid
            email address.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.5. Emails: ChakaDeals may send you administrative and promotional emails. We may also
            send you information regarding your Account activity and purchases, as well as updates
            about our Site and Services or other promotional offers. We may also send you information
            regarding purchases you’ve made. (You can opt-out of our promotional e-mails at any time
            by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of such e-mail correspondence.)
            </p> <br>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            2.6. Push Notifications: Where you have consented, ChakaDeals may send you promotional
            push notifications on your mobile device(s) for general and location-based deals. You can

           <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            3.9 On behalf of the Merchant, ChakaDeals may collect booking fees or other costs
            associated with the purchase and/or redemption of a Voucher. All such fees or costs (if any)
            will be communicated to you before you purchase the Voucher.

           <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            3.10 In the event that a Merchant cannot supply and/or provide the Merchant Offering as
            described for unforeseen reasons, ChakaDeals will notify you as soon as possible by email.
            ChakaDeals will offer you either a new voucher with comparable benefits (if available) or the
            repayment of the purchase price of the Voucher.

            4. Use of a Voucher</p>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            4.1 Any purchase of a Voucher is for your non-commercial, personal use only (although you
            may give the Voucher to someone else for their non-commercial, personal use). The
            commercial trade of a Voucher is prohibited. The reproduction of a Voucher is prohibited.</p>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            4.2 Your Voucher is solely your responsibility. Neither ChakaDeals nor the Merchant or
            ChakaDeals Shop are responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or for retrieving Voucher
            reference numbers or Voucher security codes.</p>
            <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            4.3 You promise not to provide false data including false names, addresses and/or contact
            or payment details; or engage in any unlawful activity in connection with the purchase or
            use of a Voucher, or allow anyone else to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            4.4 Any attempt to redeem a Voucher contrary to these Terms of Sale may render a Voucher
            void at ChakaDeals’s discretion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5. Cancellation (and exceptions), Refunds and Problems
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5.1 You have a statutory right to cancel your purchase of the Voucher within 14 calendar
            days after the day you receive the confirmation email (the “Voucher Cancellation Period”).
            However, if you redeem your Voucher during the Voucher Cancellation Period, you
            expressly request the services to begin being provided to you, and you acknowledge that
            you lose your right to cancel the purchase of the Voucher . Since ChakaDeals is not
            responsible for the supply or provision of the Merchant Offering, once your Voucher is
            redeemed ChakaDeals has completed its services to you in full. Please note that, for the
            avoidance of doubt, this section also applies to all “Direct Checkout” deals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5.2 If you want to cancel your purchase of a Voucher you can do so in any of the following
            ways:
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">

            5.3 If you cancel your purchase of the Voucher in accordance with this section 5, ChakaDeals
            will refund you for all payments made as part of your purchase within 14 calendar days
            from the day on which you informed ChakaDeals about your cancellation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5.4 If you redeem your Voucher, but the Merchant or ChakaDeals Shop has not properly
            provided you with the Merchant Offering or the ChakaDeals Shop Goods, or if you have a
            complaint regarding the provision of the Merchant Offering or the ChakaDeals Shop Goods,
            you must take action against the Merchant or ChakaDeals Shop directly. This is because the
            Merchant or ChakaDeals Shop, and not ChakaDeals, is responsible for the supply and/or
            provision of the Merchant Offering or ChakaDeals Shop Goods. ChakaDeals only sells and
            supplies the Voucher. However, if you and the Merchant or ChakaDeals Shop cannot agree on how to resolve the
            complaint, ChakaDeals may, upon your request, try to help resolve
            the issue between you and the Merchant or ChakaDeals Shop.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5.5 Unless you expressly inform ChakaDeals in advance not to, any refund will be refunded
            to you via your original method of payment. If your original method of payment has been
            cancelled, expired or has otherwise changed, you must inform the customer support team
            immediately at hello@chakadeals.com. If you fail to do this and you are refunded to your
            original method of payment, you may need to coordinate with your bank or your payment
            services provider to obtain your refund. ChakaDeals will not provide more than one refund.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify text-sm leading-9 Gotham-Light">
            5.6 You have 30 days from the date you receive the refund to reject it. If you do not reject
            the refund during these 30 days, the refund shall be in full and final settlement of any and
            all claims you may have against ChakaDeals related to, arising out of, or connected to that
            Voucher.

            or damages you may suffer, including any indirect or consequential losses.
            <br>
            7.4 ChakaDeals does not promise
            the completeness, fitness for purpose or legality of the

            <br>

            not mean that ChakaDeals has waived its rights and remedies with regard to your breach.
            ChakaDeals may still take action or exercise its rights and remedies for that action, or any
            other situation, where you breach your obligations under these Terms of Sale.
            <br>
            9.2 Unless otherwise stated within these Terms of Sale, notices to be given to either party
            shall be in writing and shall be delivered by electronic mail (other than if you are sending a
            notice to ChakaDeals for the purpose of legal process) or by pre-paid post. Any notice
            ChakaDeals sends to you will be to the address you supplied to ChakaDeals when you
            registered for your ChakaDeals account. You can send any notice to ChakaDeals at the
            registered office address as set out in section 1.2.
            <br>
            9.3 If any provision of these Terms of Sale should be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
            validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Sale are not
            affected. Such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and
            enforceable provision which most closely achieves the economic effect contemplated by the
            invalid or unenforceable provision.
            <br>
            9.4 We will do our best to resolve any disputes about these Terms of Sale. If you wish to
            bring a legal claim against us, you must do so within the United Kingdom (and English courts
            shall have the exclusive jurisdiction for your legal claim). If you live in England and Wales,
            the laws of England shall apply; if you live in Scotland, then Scottish law shall apply; if you live in
            Northern Ireland, then Northern Irish law shall apply. The previous sentence applies
            to all non-contractual relationships between you and us. The parties also agree that the
            United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this
            transaction.

            2. Pricing and purchase <br>
            2.1. Pricing and whom you pay: We will take and process your payment for your order. All

            <br>
            2.2. Delivery charges: Prices may or may not include delivery charges. Any such
            charges
            will be stated in the “Fine Print” section of the deal. If delivery charges are not included in
            the purchase price, such costs will be displayed separately and added to the total amount
            due before you complete your order. If we are required to schedule a delivery time with you
            and you are not available at the agreed time, we may charge you the costs of rescheduling
            the delivery. <br>
            2.3. Placing your order: After you place an order by clicking the “Buy Now” button and
            agreeing to these Terms of Sale, the contract is complete after you receive an email

            and not conclude a contract with you. If we accepted your order, you will receive another
            email confirming dispatch of the Goods. Please note that, if we reasonably believe your
            order is fraudulent or you have otherwise violated applicable law when ordering, even if we
            have accepted your order, we reserve the right to cancel it. <br>
            2.4. Errors and omissions: Occasionally there may be an error or omission related to the
            pricing or description of the Goods we sell. We will use reasonable endeavour to correct
            any errors or omissions as soon as practicable after being notified or learning of them. We
            reserve the right to change, modify, substitute, suspend, or remove without notice any
            information related to Goods for sale (including the Goods themselves). <br>
            2.5. Post-purchase errors and omissions: Where we have made an error or omission and
            you have already purchased the Goods:
            (a) if the actual price of the Goods is less than the stated price at the time you purchased the
            Goods, we will charge you the lower price; or
            (b) if the price of the Goods is higher than the stated price, we will contact you and allow you
            the option to pay the correct (higher) price or cancel your order and receive a full refund. <br>

            3.1. Changing your order: Once you have placed your order, we are unable to make any
            changes to your order, including the quantity of Goods ordered or the delivery address. This
            Clause does not impact your legal rights to cancel or any rights to return you may have for
            the particular purchase. <br>
            3.2. Shipping: ChakaDeals Goods shipping options will vary by offer. Your purchase is not

            we can to meet the date given for delivery. Please note that unless otherwise stated,
            delivery estimates are only estimates; they are not guaranteed delivery times and should
            not be relied upon as such.3.4. Title: Legal title to the Goods will transfer to you (i.e. the Goods will

            receive the Goods. In the event you have ordered multiple Goods in one order, or the
            delivery of your Goods consists of multiple pieces, the cancellation period does not begin

            they will not be damaged in transit. You will be responsible for the cost of returning the
            Goods to us. We recommend that you use a recorded delivery service when returning the
            Goods. <br>
            4.4. The following Goods are excluded from this legal right to cancel:
            (a) perishable Goods such as food or flowers;

            (e) lotteries or gambling games; and
            (f) any other Goods that by reason of their nature cannot be returned, including those that
            would be damaged by transit. <br>
            4.5. Returning the Goods: Please note that if you exercise your right to cancel your order,
            you must return the Goods to us within 14 calendar days of such cancellation.4.6. We may cancel: We may have

            an event outside our reasonable control, including due to equipment breakdown or
            transportation difficulties. We will promptly contact you if this happens. <br>
            5. Returns and refunds <br>
            5.1. Our Returns Policy: Every item we sell is backed by our Returns Policy . In addition to
            your right to return Goods within 14 calendar days from the day that you, or a third party
            indicated by you, receive the Goods, you also retain all applicable legal rights to return new
            or refurbished Goods, including where goods supplied to you are incorrect or faulty. <br>
            5.2. Title to returned Goods: We take legal title to the returned Goods only after the Goods
            arrive at our returns destination. We reserve the right to issue a refund without requiring a
            return. In this situation, we do not take title to the returned Goods. <br>
            5.3. Problems with your returned Goods: We reserve the right to refuse to issue a refund
            and to recover the cost of the delivery of your return from you in the event that the Goods
            are found to have suffered damage after delivery to you; the Goods have been misused or
            used other than in accordance with the instructions or for inspection purposes; or if the
            problem with the Goods is due to normal wear and tear. This Clause 5.3 does not limit or
            affect your right to cancel your contract and return goods under Clause 4, or your rights
            where goods supplied to you are incorrect or faulty. <br>
            6. Goods information  <br>
            6.1. We aren’t the manufacturer: We are not the manufacturer of the Goods we sell. While
            we work to ensure that the Goods match the description we have provided, are of
            satisfactory quality and are fit for use, the Goods may vary slightly from such product
            information. We encourage you to read all information presented on labels, warnings and
            directions which accompany the Goods before use. Any guarantee provided by us, the
            manufacturer or importer does not affect the legal rights and claims that you may apply
            under the contract. <br>
            6.2. Accuracy of descriptions: We have taken reasonable steps to display as accurately as
            possible the colours and other detailing of the Goods. However, the colours and detailing
            you see on the advertisement will depend on the equipment you use to view the Goods. We
            cannot guarantee that the display of any colour or other detailing on your television, mobile
            device, computer monitor or other device will exactly reflect the colour or detailing of the
            Goods upon delivery.  <br>
            6.3. Healthcare Goods and safety: For healthcare Goods, in the event of any safety
            concerns or for any other information about a product, we recommend you carefully read
            the information provided with the product or contact the manufacturer. Content on the
            website is not intended to substitute for advice given by a medical practitioner, pharmacist
            or other licensed healthcare professional. Customers should contact their healthcare
            provider immediately if they suspect that they have a medical problem. Information and
            statements about Goods are not intended to be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or health
            condition. We accept no liability for inaccuracies or misstatements about
            Goods by manufacturers or other third parties. <br>
            7. Liability <br>
            7.1. The standards we operate under: We always try our best at what we do and promise
            that:
            (a) we will exercise reasonable care and skill in performing any obligation under these
            Terms of Sale;
            (b) we have the right to sell Goods;
            (c) we only sell the Goods for domestic and private use;
            (d) Goods are of satisfactory quality and fit for their purpose, and
            (e) we will not contravene the requirements of professional diligence in what we do. <br>
            7.2. This Clause 7 takes precedence over all other Clauses (except for Clause 1.5) and sets
            forth our entire Liability. <br>
            7.3. What we are responsible for: Nothing in these Terms of Sale shall exclude or limit our
            Liability for any Liability for (i) fraud; (ii) serious misconduct by us, excluding serious
            misconduct not conducted by us; or (iii) any Liability which cannot be excluded or limited by
            applicable law. You are obliged to take adequate measures to avert and reduce damages.
            <br>
            7.4. Categories of loss that we are not responsible for : Notwithstanding Clause 7.3, since
            we only sell Goods for domestic and private use, we are in principle not liable for:
            (a) loss of revenue or income;
            (b) loss of actual or anticipated profits;
            (c) loss of business; and
            (d) indirect or consequential loss (and for the avoidance of doubt, we understand the words
            “consequential loss” to mean “consequential losses whether those losses are foreseeable,
            known, foreseen or otherwise”). <br>
            7.5. “Liability” means liability in or for any cause of action whatsoever (including breach of
            contract, tort, misrepresentation, restitution or any other cause of action whatsoever)
            relating to or arising under or in connection with these Terms of Sale (including liability
            expressly provided for under these Terms of Sale or arising by reason of the invalidity or
            unenforceability of any term of these Terms of Sale).
            <br>
            8. General <br>
            8.1. Interpretation: In these Terms of Sale:
            (a) words denoting persons include natural persons, partnerships, limited liability
            partnerships, bodies corporate and unincorporated associations of persons;
            (b) Clause headings such as ("8. General" at the start of this Clause) and Clause titles (such
            as "Interpretation:" at the start of this Clause 8.1) are purely for ease of reference and do
            not form part of or affect the interpretation of these Terms of Sale; and
            (c) references to "include" and "including" shall be deemed to mean respectively "include(s)
            without limitation" and "including without limitation". <br>
            8.2. No partnership/agency: Nothing in these Terms of Sale shall be construed to create a
            joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between you and us and neither party shall
            have the right or authority to incur any liability, debt or cost, or enter into any contracts or
            other arrangements in the name of or on behalf of the other. <br>
            8.3. Assignment: You may not assign or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of your
            rights or obligations under these Terms of Sale without our prior written approval. We will
            not refuse this approval without good reason. We shall have the right to assign or otherwise
            delegate all or any of our rights or obligations under these Terms of Sale to any person. <br>
            8.4. Events beyond our reasonable control: We shall not be liable for any breach of our
            obligations under this Agreement where we are hindered or prevented from carrying out
            our obligations by any cause outside our reasonable control. Where there has been an
            event outside our reasonable control which has affected our ability to perform our
            obligations under these Terms of Sale, our obligations will be extended for the duration of
            the event and we will notify you of this as soon as reasonably possible. Once the event is
            completed we will arrange with you a new delivery date for your Goods, if possible. <br>
            
            8.5. Our reliance: We intend to rely upon only the written terms set out in these Terms of
            Sale in respect of the Sale of Goods to you and not any representations made elsewhere. <br>
            8.6. No waiver: No waiver by us of any breach of yours under these Terms of Sale shall
            operate or be construed as a waiver by us of any future breaches, whether of a like or
            different character. No delay by us in taking action in the event of your breach shall in any
            way release, discharge or otherwise affect your liability under these Terms of Sale. <br>
            8.7. Notices: Unless otherwise stated within these Terms of Sale, notices to be given to
            either party shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand, electronic mail (other than, if
            you are sending a notice to us for the purpose of legal process) or by pre-paid post, to you
            at the address you supplied to us or to us at our registered office. <br>
            8.8. No third party rights: All provisions of these Terms of Sale apply equally to and are for
            the benefit of ChakaDeals Goods, its subsidiaries, any holding companies of ChakaDeals
            Goods, its (or their) affiliates and its (or their) third party content providers and licensors and each
            shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own
            behalf (save that these Terms of Sale may be varied or rescinded without the consent of
            those parties). Subject to the previous sentence, no term of these Terms of Sale is otherwise
            enforceable by any person who is not a party to it. <br>
            8.9. Survival: In any event, the provisions of Clauses 1, 2, 4, 7 and 8 of these Terms of Sale,
            together with those provisions that either are expressed to survive its expiry or termination
            or from their nature or context it is contemplated that they are to survive such termination,
            shall survive termination of the Agreement. <br>
            8.10. Severability: If any provision of these Terms of Sale is held to be unlawful, invalid or
            unenforceable, that provision shall be removed from the Terms of Sale without affecting the
            rest of the Terms of Sale. Where capable, the validity and enforceability of the remaining
            provisions of these Terms of Sale shall not be affected. <br>
            8.11. Governing law and dispute resolution: We will do our best to resolve any disputes
            about these Terms of Sale. If you wish to bring a legal claim against us, these Terms of Sale
            (and all non-contractual relationships between you and us) shall be governed by and
            construed in accordance with English and Welsh law if you live in England or Wales, Scottish
            law if you live in Scotland or Northern Irish law if you live in Northern Ireland, and both
            parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of England and
            Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The parties also agree that the United Nations

            1. General Information
            <br>
            1.1 These Terms of Sale apply to every Voucher you purchase from ChakaDeals.
            <br>
            1.2 ChakaDeals means Unchained Warrior Limited registered office at 7 Bell Yard, London
            WC2A 2JR, United Kingdom with registration number:
            <br>
            1.3 Voucher means an instrument, in either physical or electronic form, which entitles the
            holder of such Voucher (the “Voucher Holder”) to receive the Merchant Offering from the
            Merchant during the period of time stated on the Voucher (the “Redemption Period”).
            <br>
            1.4 The Merchant Offering shall mean the goods and/or services to be supplied and/or
            provided by the Merchant to the Voucher Holder, as specified on ChakaDeals’s Site and on
            the Voucher.
            <br>
            1.5 The Merchant is a third party unrelated to ChakaDeals that sells, supplies and/or
            provides the Merchant Offering. ChakaDeals does not sell, supply and/or provide the
            Merchant Offering. It only sells and supplies the Voucher.
            <br>
            1.6 These Terms of Sale were last updated on 20.08.2022 (version 004). ChakaDeals reserves
            the right to unilaterally amend these Terms of Sale at any time. All amendments to these
            Terms of Sale will be posted on-line. You will be bound only to the version of the Terms of
            Sale you agreed to at the time you purchase a Voucher.
            <br>
            2. Purchase of a Voucher
            <br>
            2.1 You must be at least 18 years old to purchase a Voucher. Before you can make a
            purchase you need to register and create an account with ChakaDeals.
            <br>
            2.2 By clicking on the “Buy Now” button you submit an offer to ChakaDeals to buy the
            Voucher. However, the purchase of the Voucher is not complete until you receive an email
            from ChakaDeals confirming acceptance of your offer. ChakaDeals expressly reserves the
            right to reject your offer. In addition, even if ChakaDeals has accepted your offer, it can
            cancel the contract at any time if it reasonably suspects that you have committed or that
            you may be committing any fraud against ChakaDeals, an affiliated third party of
            ChakaDeals or the Merchant.
            <br>
            2.3 The Merchant may have its own terms and conditions applicable to the sale, supply
            and/or provision of the Merchant Offering.
            <br>
            3. Redemption of a Voucher
            <br>
            3.1 Unless expressly stated otherwise:
            (a) the Voucher can only be redeemed once;
            (b) the Voucher can only be redeemed with the Merchant and not with ChakaDeals;
            (c) the Voucher is valid for one person only; and
            (d) you must follow the redemption instructions associated with the Voucher when you
            redeem the Voucher with the Merchant.
            3.2 All Vouchers sold by ChakaDeals are single-purpose Vouchers which can only be
            redeemed with the Merchant.
            <br>
            3.3 In order to redeem a Voucher you must present it to the Merchant within the
            Redemption Period. If you do not redeem the Voucher within the Redemption Period, the
            Voucher expires automatically. It cannot be redeemed anymore and you are not entitled to
            any reimbursement or compensation. <br>
            3.4 In the event that a Merchant Offering on the ChakaDeals Site is a “Direct Checkout” deal,
            ChakaDeals will collect your shipping details at the time of purchase. ChakaDeals will then pass these
            details to the Merchant on your behalf. The Merchant will then process the
            redemption of your Voucher and dispatch the Merchant Offering to you.
            <br>
            3.5 Unless expressly stated otherwise, the Voucher does not entitle the Voucher Holder to
            receive the Merchant Offering at a specific time. You are strongly recommended to contact
            the Merchant at an early stage. Doing so will give you the best chance of securing your
            preferred time for the supply and/or provision of the Merchant Offering. ChakaDeals cannot
            influence the supply and/or provision of the Merchant Offering.
            <br>
        
            3.6 If you redeem the Voucher for goods and/or services other than the Merchant Offering,
            you will not be entitled to a credit, cash refund or new Voucher for the difference between
            the value of the Merchant Offering and the actual value of the goods and/or services
            supplied and/or provided by the Merchant to you. <br>
            3.7 Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety only. They may not be redeemed partially or
            incrementally. If, for whatever reason, you redeem the Voucher with a Merchant for less
            than the original (un-discounted) value of the Merchant Offering, you are not entitled to a
            credit, cash refund or new Voucher for the difference between the original (un-discounted)
            value and the redeemed value. <br>
            3.8 On behalf of the Merchant, ChakaDeals may collect booking fees or other costs
            associated with the purchase and/or redemption of a Voucher. All such fees or costs (if any)
            will be communicated to you before you purchase the Voucher. <br>
            3.9 In the event that a Merchant cannot supply and/or provide the Merchant Offering as
            described for unforeseen reasons, ChakaDeals will notify you as soon as possible by email.
            ChakaDeals will offer you either a new voucher with comparable benefits (if available) or the
            repayment of the purchase price of the Voucher. <br>
        
            4. Use of a Voucher <br>
            4.1 Any purchase of a Voucher is for your non-commercial, personal use only (although you
            may give the Voucher to someone else for their non-commercial, personal use). <br>
            4.2 Your Voucher is solely your responsibility. Neither ChakaDeals nor the Merchant are
            responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or for retrieving Voucher reference numbers or
            Voucher security codes. <br>
            4.3 You promise not to provide false data including false names, addresses and/or contact
            or payment details; or engage in any unlawful activity in connection with the purchase or
            use of a Voucher, or allow anyone else to do so. <br>
       
            4.4 Any attempt to redeem a Voucher contrary to these Terms of Sale may render a Voucher
            void at ChakaDeals’s discretion.
            <br>
            4.5 The reproduction of a Voucher is prohibited.
            <br>
            4.6 The commercial trade of a Voucher is prohibited.5. Cancellation (and exceptions), Refunds and Problems
            <br>
            5.1 If your Voucher is for a specific date or period, your purchase is final and you do not
            have the right to withdraw.
            <br>
            5.2 For Vouchers other than those mentioned in Section 5.1 above you have a statutory
            right to withdraw from your purchase of the Voucher by contacting the customer service
            within 14 days after the day you receive the confirmation email (the “Voucher Cancellation
            Period”. However, if you redeem the Voucher, you expressly request ChakaDeals to begin
            providing the services to you, and you acknowledge that you lose your right to cancel the
            purchase of the Voucher. Since ChakaDeals is not responsible for the supply or provision of
            the Merchant Offering, once your Voucher is redeemed ChakaDeals has completed its
            services to you in full. Please note that, for the avoidance of doubt, this section also applies
            to all “Direct Checkout” deals.
            <br>
        
            5.3 If you want to cancel your purchase of a Voucher you can do so by cancelling from your
            account online
            <br>
            5.4 If you cancel your purchase of the Voucher in accordance with this section 5, ChakaDeals
            will refund you for all payments made as part of your purchase within 14 calendar days
            from the day on which you informed ChakaDeals about your cancellation.
            <br>
       5.5 If you have been unable to redeem your Voucher with the Merchant before the expiry of
            the Redemption Period through no fault of your own, you may be entitled to a refund. In
            order to receive a refund, you must prove to ChakaDeals’s reasonable satisfaction that your
            inability to redeem the Voucher was not your fault. The decision to grant a refund is within
            the sole discretion of ChakaDeals. <br>
            5.6 If you redeem your Voucher, but the Merchant has not properly provided you with the
            Merchant Offering, or if you have a complaint regarding the provision of the Merchant
            Offering, you must act against the Merchant directly. This is because the Merchant, and not
            ChakaDeals, is responsible for the supply and/or provision of the Merchant Offering.
            ChakaDeals only sells and supplies the Voucher. However, if you and the Merchant cannot
            agree on how to resolve the complaint, ChakaDeals may, upon your request, try to help
            resolve the issue between you and the Merchant. <br>
            5.7 Unless you expressly inform ChakaDeals in advance not to, any refund in cash will be
            refunded to you via your original method of payment. If your original method of payment
            has been cancelled, expired, or has otherwise changed, you must inform the customer
            support team immediately at hello@chakadeals.com . If you fail to do this and you are
            refunded to your original method of payment, you may need to coordinate with your bank
            or your payment services provider to obtain your refund. ChakaDeals will not provide more
            than one refund. 
            <br>
            5.8 You have 30 days from the date you receive the refund to reject it. If you do not reject
            the refund during these 30 days, the refund shall be in full and final settlement of any and
            all claims you may have against ChakaDeals related to, arising out of, or connected to that
            Voucher.
            <br> 
            6. Responsibility for the Merchant Offering
            <br>
            6.1 Please note that the Merchant, and not ChakaDeals, is:
            <br>
            6.1.1 the seller, supplier and/or provider of the Merchant Offering;
            <br>
            6.1.2 the party who enters into a contract with the Voucher Holder when the Voucher is
            redeemed; and
            <br>
            6.1.3 solely responsible for providing the Voucher Holder with the Merchant Offering and
            for the Merchant Offering itself.

            excluded or limited under applicable law.
            <br>

            7.3 Other than as set out in section 7.2 above, ChakaDeals is not liable for any losses not
            caused by its breach or any other losses or damages you may suffer, including any indirect

          <br>  9.1 If you breach these Terms of Sale and ChakaDeals takes no action against you this does
            not mean that ChakaDeals has waived its rights and remedies with regard to your breach.

            validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Sale are not
            affected. Such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and
            enforceable provision which most closely achieves the economic effect contemplated by the
            invalid or unenforceable provision.
        <br>    9.4 We will do our best to resolve any disputes about these Terms of Sale. If you wish to
            bring a legal claim against us, you must do so within the United Kingdom (and English courts

            the laws of England shall apply; if you live in Scotland, then Scottish law shall apply; if you

        <span class="font-bold text-xl"> RESERVATION TERMS OF SALE</span> <br>
            This document sets out the reservation terms and conditions of sale for the use of the
            Services of ChakaDeals Travel GmbH (the “Terms of Sale”). It is not possible to use the
            Services (including making a Reservation or a Purchase) without agreeing to these Terms of
            Sale. Please note that these Terms of Sale do NOT apply to the purchase of any item on the
            marketplace other than Accommodation, as such purchases have their own applicable
            terms of sale.
        
            <br>
            1. BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TERMS OF SALE
            <br>
            1.1. ChakaDeals Travel is a subsidiary of Unchained Warrior Limited with address and
            registered detail as stated above.1.2. ChakaDeals Travel and Suppliers: For any Reservation and any
            subsequent Purchase
            we act as an agent for the Supplier. The Accommodation featured on the ChakaDeals Site
            does not constitute an offer by us to sell any such Accommodation, but represents an
            invitation to you to make an offer to our Suppliers. We are free to accept that offer on
            behalf of those Suppliers or to reject it. This means that the contract for the Accommodation
            is between you and the Supplier. It is the Supplier (or where relevant, the Supplier’s
            principal) who is legally responsible for providing your Accommodation to you. As an agent,
            we are never legally responsible for the supply of your Accommodation. We say more about
            this below.
            <br>
            1.3. What are these Terms of Sale? Please read these Terms of Sale carefully as they apply
            to your use of the Services, any Reservations, any Purchase and any Accommodation (or
            otherwise). We will not allow you to make any Reservation or Purchase unless you have
            confirmed that you have read and accepted these Terms of Sale. Suppliers will have their
            own applicable terms and conditions that will apply to your Reservation and any
            subsequent Purchase. These Terms of Sale are subject to any relevant Supplier’s terms and
            conditions and you agree to abide by those terms and conditions when making a
            Reservation and any subsequent Purchase. In the event there is a conflict between these
            Terms of Sale and any Supplier terms and conditions, the Supplier’s terms and conditions
            shall take precedence and prevail over these Terms of Sale to the extent of any conflict.
       <br>
            1.4. The ChakaDeals Site: Our corporate affiliate ChakaDeals in (“ ChakaDeals”) is
            operating the web and mobile sites and newsletter services where we feature
            Accommodations and Reservations. ChakaDeals Travel is one of a number of sellers
            operating on the ChakaDeals Site. If you interact with the ChakaDeals Site in any way, you
            will likely see references to a number of companies in the ChakaDeals group of companies
            (“ChakaDeals Group”). Depending on what you purchase from the ChakaDeals Site there will
            likely be several contracts with different companies in the ChakaDeals Group relevant to
            you. These Terms of Sale only apply in respect of your use of our Services.
            <br>
            1.5. Privacy Practices: When you make a Reservation or Purchase through ChakaDeals

            our Privacy Statement.

            1.6. These Terms of Sale: You accept these Terms of Sale when you use our Services
            (including making a Reservation or a Purchase). When we send you an email confirming
            your Reservation a contract is formed between you and us, which is governed by these
            Terms of Sale.
           <br>
            1.7. Your legal rights: As a consumer, nothing in these Terms of Sale affects your legal
            rights. Advice about your legal rights is available at your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or
            Trading Standards office.

            1.8. Updates to these Terms of Sale: These Terms of Sale were most recently updated on
            27.06.2017. We reserve the right to amend these Terms of Sale at any time (which we will
            post online). Any amendments to these Terms of Sale made after you have received your
            Reservation confirmation email will not apply to you in respect of that Reservation and any
            subsequent Purchase relating to such Reservation.1.9. Definitions: In these Terms of Sale, various defined
            terms will be used. You will know
            they are defined because they begin with a capital letter. Defined terms are defined

            Travel and any Supplier reserves the right to cancel your Purchase at any time for any
            failure by you to disclose any and all relevant information, whether about yourself or other

            2.2.3. you recognize and agree that it is your responsibility to disclose facts about yourself
            and individuals for whom you Reserve that may affect your (or their) ability to travel, such as
            any criminal offenses and previous deportations from the destination(s) that you are
            traveling to;
           <br>
            2.2.4. if you or any individual for whom you Reserve wishes to travel to a jurisdiction
            (including the USA) that requires declaration of criminal records and you or any individual
            for whom you Reserve has any criminal records, including driving offenses, that you will
            declare such records at the time of Reservation; and
           <br> 2.2.5. you are aware of all rules regarding the entrance to a territory or country to which you
            are traveling (as well as those on whose behalf you Reserved), including any passport
            restrictions and requirements (such as blank passport pages or passport validity); you do
            not have a criminal record that would prevent you from traveling to that territory or
            country; and you meet the appropriate visa, vaccination, administrative and sanitation
            requirements. ChakaDeals Travel shall not be responsible if you are denied entrance to the
            territory or country of your Accommodation for failing to disclose any of the above. Further,
            should you be so denied, you are not entitled to a refund in any amount.
           <br> 2.3. Reserving for others: If you Reserve for individuals other than yourself, you represent
            that you are authorized to make such a Reservation on behalf of such individuals and that
            all individuals in the Reservation (and their personal representatives) have agreed to be
            bound by these Terms of Sale.
          <br>  2.4. Behavior: You undertake not to behave in a way that may cause distress, annoyance
            or may create the risk of danger to other individuals and/or damage to property during your
            use of the Accommodation. If at any time from departure until your return you (or any individual for whom you Reserve) are arrested or prevented from traveling at the discretion
            of a Supplier, or if you are evicted from your Accommodation at the discretion of a Supplier,
            we will not refund, on behalf of the Supplier, any portion of the purchase price of your
            Accommodation that you are unable to use as a result of your behavior (or the behavior
            of any individual for whom you Reserve). You agree to pay us for any losses, liabilities,
            damages or costs incurred by us arising out of any claims or legal proceedings which are
            brought or threatened against us by any person arising from or in connection with your
            behavior (or the behavior of any individual for whom you Reserve) under these Terms of
            Sale.
          <br>  2.5. Fraud: If either we or a Supplier are notified or become aware of any suspected or
            actual fraud or illegal activity associated with any payments made in respect of a
            Reservation or a Purchase, we reserve the right within our sole discretion to cancel your
            Reservation or Purchase with immediate effect and without any compensation owed to you.
            Such right to cancel shall apply in addition to any other rights we may have against you.
          <br>  3. RESERVING ACCOMMODATION
           <br> 3.1. Making a Reservation: Subject to availability, you can make a Reservation online,
            through the ChakaDeals Site. To Reserve you must select the Accommodation you would
            like to purchase, select your room type and travel dates, click “Book!”, enter your email
            address and other personal information that we need so that you may login to your account
            or create an account, agree to these Reservation Terms of Sale and click “Complete Order”.
            Upon successful completion of these steps you will see a page on the ChakaDeals Site
            acknowledging our receipt of your Reservation.
           <br> 3.2. Accepting your Reservation: We reserve the right to determine, within our sole
            discretion, whether to accept your Reservation. Your Reservation is not accepted by us until
            (and unless) you are informed that your Reservation has been accepted. If we reject your
            Reservation we will let you know and no payment will be taken from you. If we accept your
            Reservation, we will send you a Reservation confirmation email confirming your
            Accommodation. It is at this point – our sending of the Reservation confirmation email – that
            we accept your Reservation and a contract between you and us is formed. We will take
            payment shortly thereafter.
          <br>  3.3. Checking your Reservation confirmation: It is important that you check the details on
            the Reservation confirmation email when you receive it. In the event of any discrepancy
            between your Reservation and the Reservation confirmation email, or if you do not receive
            the Reservation confirmation email within 24 hours of making the Reservation, please
            contact us immediately by email at hello@chakadeals.com.
          <br>  3.4. Your contract for the supply of Accommodation: Please note that it is the Supplier
            who is legally responsible for supplying you the Accommodation (though we remain
            responsible for what we set out in these Terms of Sale). As an agent, we are not legally
            responsible for the provision of your Accommodation, which will be supplied by the Supplier
            to you, under a contract between you and the Supplier. You agree and understand that by
            Reserving, the actual supply of your Accommodation (which is not what these Terms of Sale
            are about) will be under the terms and conditions of a Supplier.4. PRICING
         <br>   4.1. Whom you pay: All payments made by you for Accommodation will be taken by us, on
            behalf of Supplier, shortly after we confirm acceptance of your Reservation by sending you
            your Reservation confirmation email (as set out above).
         <br>   4.2. Final price: We reserve the right to alter the prices of any Accommodation prior to
            Reservation. You will be advised of the current price of any Accommodation before you
            Reserve. This price may be different to the price originally represented to you on the
            ChakaDeals Site.
        <br>    4.3. Pricing errors: In certain instances we may make a mistake and there may be errors in
            pricing when you Reserve. If we have made an error (whether it is human, technical or
            otherwise), we reserve the right to offer you the option of re-making a Reservation at the
            correct price or refunding you in full.
         <br>   4.4. Taxes: In certain countries there may be taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
            assessments, or other charges (collectively, “Taxes”) levied by local authorities. Applicable
            Taxes for your Reservation will be set out to you prior to Reservation, including in the fine
            print or elsewhere on the ChakaDeals Site. Please note that you shall be solely and
            exclusively liable and responsible for paying all such Taxes.
         <br>   4.5. Added Extras: You are advised that during and throughout your use of the
            Accommodation added extras may be available for you to purchase. Such added extras may
            include meals at your hotel, internet at your hotel, etc. (“Added Extras”). To the extent you
            did not purchase such Added Extras from us, any Added Extras will be your sole financial
            liability and the responsibility for the provision of these Added Extras lies with the supplier
            of such Added Extras (including any Supplier). ChakaDeals Travel shall have no liability or
            responsibility in the provision, fulfillment, enjoyment, supply or otherwise of any Added
            Extras.
        <br>    4.6. Post-Reservation price revision for Accommodation: Subject to Clause 5, ChakaDeals
            Travel will not change the price of your Accommodation after we have sent you a
            Reservation confirmation email.
        <br>    4.7. Refunds: In the event you receive a refund (in whole or in part), you will be refunded via
            your original method of payment. Where you are given a refund, you have 30 days from the
            date you receive the refund to reject it. If you do not reject the refund during this time, the
            refund is always in full and final settlement of any and all claims you may have against
            ChakaDeals Travel related to, arising out of, or connected with, the Services, the Reservation
            or Purchase in respect of which you were refunded.
           <br> 5. CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS
           <br> 5.1. If you change your details:
           <br> 5.1.1. Please note that ChakaDeals Travel may not be able to change the name of individuals
            on your Reservation. Whether we agree to such a name change request is solely within our discretion. If we do
            not change a name on your Reservation then you may need to cancel
            and re-Reserve, subject to availability (and incur any associated costs in respect of such
            cancellation). If you would like to inquire about changing a name, please contact at
            hello@chakadeals.com.
           <br> 5.1.2. Any change of details other than a name change may not be possible. However, you
            may always cancel your Purchase and Reserve again, subject to availability (but please see
            what we say about such cancellations in Clause 5.2 below).
           <br> 5.2. If you cancel your Accommodation: Please note that any Purchase is cancellable, free
            of charge, until the cancellation date (if there is a cancellation date). You will see the
            cancellation date as part of the general restrictions of the Accommodation. The cancellation
            date will also be available in your Reservation confirmation email. Once the cancellation
            date has passed, your Purchase is non-refundable and non-cancellable. Please review the
            terms of the particular Accommodation you want to Reserve in respect of its cancellation
            date, as the cancellation date varies from Accommodation to Accommodation. If the reason
            for cancellation is covered under the terms of an insurance policy you have taken out in
            respect of your Purchase, you may be able to reclaim any charges we may charge you for
            your cancellation under that insurance policy. If you would like to discuss cancellation,
            contact us by email at hello@chakadeals.com.
         <br>   5.3. If a Supplier changes your Accommodation: Occasionally, a Supplier may have to
            make a change to your Purchase. We or the Supplier will advise you of all such changes as
            soon as reasonably possible setting out the details of your updated Purchase and
            Accommodation. We take no responsibility or liability for any such change as we are not the
            Supplier.
        <br>    5.4. If a Supplier cancels your Accommodation: We reserve the right to cancel your
            Purchase for any reason and without any compensation being owed if the cancellation is
            due to reasons of Force Majeure or failure by you to pay the full cost of your
            Accommodation or otherwise in accordance with the terms of these Terms of Sale.
         <br>   6. STANDARDS OF CARE
         <br>   6.1. We warrant that we:
         <br>   6.1.1. will exercise reasonable skill and care in the performance of our obligations under
            these Terms of Sale;
          <br>  6.1.2. are authorised to make available the Services offered through authorised websites;
            and
           <br> 6.1.3. will not contravene the requirements of professional diligence in what we do.
           <br> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
           <br> 7.1. Limitation of liability: This Clause 7 takes precedence over all other Clauses in these
            Terms of Sale (except for Clause 1.7, to which it is subject) and sets out the entire liability ofChakaDeals
            Travel in respect of any cause of action that arises under or in connection with
            these Terms of Sale, including the performance, non-performance, purported performance
            or delay in performance of our obligations under these Terms of Sale or the Service or any
            supply of an Accommodation (or any part of it or them).
         <br>   7.2. Where we are liable: Nothing in these Terms of Sale shall exclude or limit our liability
            for any liability for (i) death or personal injury; (ii) any breach of the obligations implied by
            Section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982; (iii) fraud; (iv) fraudulent
            misrepresentation; or (v) any liability which cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.
          <br>  7.3. No liability for Suppliers where we act as agent: Where we act as an agent for
            Suppliers, our responsibility to you is to select Suppliers with reasonable skill and care. To
            the extent (i) we have acted with reasonable skill and care in selecting the Supplier(s) and (ii)
            as permitted by applicable law, we exclude all responsibility and/or liability for the provision
            of your Accommodation or any acts or omissions of the Supplier. This is because the legal
            contract and legal responsibility for the supply of your Accommodation is between you and
            the Supplier (and not ChakaDeals Travel).
           <br> 7.4. Where we are not liable: Except for what we have said in this Clause 7 and Clause 1.7,
            we will not be liable where any failure in our performance of these Terms of Sale is:
          <br>  7.4.1. attributable to you;
          <br>  7.4.2. attributable to Supplier;
          <br>  7.4.3. attributable to the failure of a third party unconnected with the provision of the
            Accommodation and where the failure is an event of Force Majeure; or

            us know the problem at hello@chakadeals.com

           <br>  9. DATA PROTECTION
           <br>  9.1. Privacy Practices: When you make a Reservation or Purchase an Accommodation
            through ChakaDeals Travel you agree that we will collect, process and use information
            about you as described in our privacy policy.
           <br>  10. USEFUL INFORMATION
           <br>  10.1. Passport requirements: A valid passport (valid for at least 6 months beyond the end
            of your holiday) is required for all Reservations and Purchases. Your specific passport and
            visa requirements and other immigration requirements are solely your responsibility. You
            should confirm these with the relevant embassies and/or consulates prior to traveling. We
            do not accept any responsibility if you cannot travel because you have not complied with
            any passport, visa or immigration requirements or if you are not in possession of the
            relevant vaccination certificates. A valid ID is sufficient for European Union citizens traveling
            in the European Union.10.2. Health information: Depending on your Purchase, there may be compulsory health
            services applicable to your trip. We strongly advise you to seek advice and
            recommendations from a health professional at least eight weeks prior to traveling
            (whether that is your GP, a practice nurse, a pharmacist or travel health clinic). Additional
            information on travel health advice for English customers can be found
            on www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk and www.nathnac.org/. Information on how to obtain
            medical treatment while abroad, as well as how to get reduced-cost and potentially free
            medical treatment while in Europe, can be found on NHS Choices
            at
            <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/Pages/Healthcareabroad.aspx." class="text-justify text-deepBlue underline" style="font-size:.6rem ;">https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/Pages/Healthcareabroad.aspx.</a>
            10.3. Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
            (FCO) provides travel advice about most destinations throughout the world. We encourage
            you to visit the FCO’s website in order to learn more about specific information relevant to
            your Purchase.
          <br>  10.4. Travel insurance: It is important and highly recommended that you have travel
            insurance which covers you for the entire duration of (and all aspects relating to) your
            Accommodation. This is to ensure that you are financially protected in the event you need to
            cancel the holiday in certain circumstances. The amount of coverage you may need will
            depend upon your particular Accommodation.
          <br>  10.5. Accommodation check-in and check-out: Accommodation check-in will depend on
            the Supplier of your Accommodation. While you must check with your particular Supplier
            prior to arrival for information on check-in and check-out times, as a general rule check-in
            will be 15:00 (local time) and check-out will be 11:00 (local time). Additionally, if you arrive
            late you should inform your Supplier to ensure any delay in checking in does not affect your
            rights. It is solely your responsibility to abide by your Supplier’s terms and conditions
            regarding check-in and check-out.

        <span class="text-xl font-bold">   CHAKADEALS THIRD PARTY INVENTORY RESERVATION TERMS OF SALE</span>
           <br> 1. General Information
           <br> 1.1 These Terms of Sale apply when you (a “Purchaser”) buy a Reservation of third party
            inventory on ChakaDeals.
          <br>  1.2 ChakaDeals means Unchained Warrior Limited (trading as ChakaDeals), a company
            incorporated under the laws of England and Wales registered in England1.3 Reservation means an entitlement
            to receive the Merchant Offering from the Merchant,
            which may also be subject to provision of a ticket or other documentation.
           <br> 1.4 The Merchant Offering shall mean the goods and/or services to be supplied and/or
            provided by the Merchant to the Purchaser, as specified on ChakaDeals’s Site.
           <br> 1.5 The Merchant is a third party unrelated to ChakaDeals that sells, supplies and/or
            provides the Merchant Offering. The contract for the supply and purchase of the Merchant
            Offering will be between you and the Merchant you purchase the Reservation for and
            ChakaDeals will conclude the contract on behalf of, and as agent for, the Merchant in all
            cases. ChakaDeals does not sell, supply and/or provide the Merchant Offering. It only sells
            the Reservation.
           <br> 1.6 These Terms of Sale were last updated on 20 May 2022 (version 001)
           <br> 1.7 ChakaDeals reserves the right to unilaterally amend these Terms of Sale at any time. All
            amendments to these Terms of Sale will be posted on-line. You will be bound only to the
            version of the Terms of Sale you agreed to at the time you purchase a Reservation.
          <br>  2. Purchase of a Reservation
           <br> 2.1 You must be at least 18 years old to purchase a Reservation. Before you can make a
            purchase, you need to register and create an account with ChakaDeals.
          <br>  2.2 By clicking on the “Buy Now” button you submit an offer to ChakaDeals to buy the
            Reservation. However, the purchase of the Reservation is not complete until you receive an
            email from ChakaDeals confirming acceptance of your offer. ChakaDeals expressly reserves
            the right to reject your order. In addition, even if ChakaDeals has accepted your order, it can
            cancel the contract at any time if it reasonably suspects that you have committed or that
            you may be committing any fraud against ChakaDeals, an affiliated third party of
            ChakaDeals or the Merchant.
          <br>  3. Receiving the Merchant Offering
          <br>  3.1 Following purchase of your Reservation, you will be provided by the Merchant with any
            additional documentation provided (such as a ticket) to enable you to receive the Merchant
            Offering. This additional documentation may be provided by a third party acting on behalf
            of the Merchant.
          <br>  3.2 Unless expressly stated otherwise, the Reservation does not entitle the Purchaser to
            receive the Merchant Offering at a specific time. You are strongly recommended to contact
            the Merchant at an early stage. Doing so will give you the best chance of securing your
            preferred time for the supply and/or provision of the Merchant Offering. ChakaDeals cannot
            influence the supply and/or provision of the Merchant Offering.
          <br>  3.3 On behalf of the Merchant, ChakaDeals may collect booking fees or other costs
            associated with the purchase and of a Reservation. All such fees or costs (if any) will be
            communicated to you before you purchase the Reservation.3.4 In the event that a Merchant cannot supply
            and/or provide the Merchant Offering as
            described for unforeseen reasons, ChakaDeals will notify you on behalf of the Merchant as
            soon as possible by email.
          <br>  4. Fraud and Unlawful Activity
          <br>  4.1 You promise not to provide false data including false names, addresses and/or contact
            or payment details; or engage in any unlawful activity in connection with the purchase of a
            Reservation, or allow anyone else to do so.
           <br> 5. Cancellation (and exceptions), Refunds and Problems
           <br> 5.1 By purchasing the Reservation, you are expressly requesting ChakaDeals’s services to
            begin being provided by you. Since ChakaDeals is not responsible for the supply or
            provision of the Merchant Offering, once the Reservation has been provided, ChakaDeals
            has completed its services to you in full. You are therefore not entitled to the 14 day
            statutory cancellation right when purchasing a Reservation from ChakaDeals.
          <br>  5.2 Your right to cancel the Merchant Offering will be subject to the Merchant’s terms and
            conditions and any applicable statutory rights.
          <br>  5.3 If you purchase a Reservation, but the Merchant has not properly provided you with the
            Merchant Offering, or if you have a complaint regarding the provision of the Merchant
            Offering, you must take action against the Merchant directly. This is because the Merchant,
            and not ChakaDeals, is responsible for the supply and/or provision of the Merchant
            Offering. ChakaDeals only sells and supplies the Reservation. However, if you and the
            Merchant cannot agree on how to resolve the complaint, ChakaDeals may, upon your
            request, try to help resolve the issue between you and the Merchant.
          <br>  5.4 Unless you expressly inform ChakaDeals in advance not to, any refund will be refunded
            to you via your original method of payment. If your original method of payment has been
            cancelled, expired or has otherwise changed, you must inform the customer support team
            immediately at hello@chakadeals.com. If you fail to do this and you are refunded to your
            original method of payment, you may need to coordinate with your bank or your payment
            services provider to obtain your refund. ChakaDeals will not provide more than one refund.
          <br>  5.6 You have 30 days from the date you receive the refund to reject it. If you do not reject
            the refund during these 30 days, the refund shall be in full and final settlement of any and
            all claims you may have against ChakaDeals related to, arising out of, or connected to that
            Reservation.
           <br> 6. Responsibility for the Merchant Offering
           <br> 6.1 Please note that the Merchant, and not ChakaDeals, is:
           <br> 6.1.1 the seller, supplier and/or provider of the Merchant Offering;6.1.2 the party who enters into a
            contract with the Purchaser after the Reservation is
            purchased; and
          <br>  6.1.3 solely responsible for providing the Purchaser with the Merchant Offering and for the
            Merchant Offering itself.
           <br> 7. ChakaDeals’s Standards of Services and Liability

           <br> 7.3 Other than as set out in section 7.2 above, ChakaDeals is not liable for any other losses
            or damages you may suffer, including any indirect or consequential losses.
           <br> 7.4 ChakaDeals does not promise the completeness, fitness for purpose or legality of the
            Merchant Offering. ChakaDeals is not liable for the quality, safety, usability or any other
            aspect of the Merchant Offering.
           <br> 7.5 ChakaDeals is not liable for any breach of an obligation under these Terms of Sale where
            it is unable to carry out its obligations by any cause outside of its reasonable control.
           <br> 7.6 Other than the liability arising under section 7.2, which is unlimited, ChakaDeals’s total
            liability to you will in no circumstances exceed the amount of 200% the purchase price of
            the Reservation.
           <br> 7.7 In certain countries applicable law does not allow some or all of the exclusions and/or
            limitations set out in this section 7. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above
            exclusions and/or limitations may not apply to you and you may have additional rights.
           <br> 8. ChakaDeals’s Site
            ChakaDeals’s Site (the “Site”) means the Internet website, mobile applications, electronic
            communications or services, or any location at which you can purchase a Reservation from
            ChakaDeals. The Site on which ChakaDeals markets the Reservations is owned by
            ChakaDeals. You can find more information about the terms of use of the Site, which are
            expressly incorporated into these Terms of Sale.
           <br> 9. Miscellaneous
           <br> 9.1 If you breach these Terms of Sale and ChakaDeals takes no action against you this does
            not mean that ChakaDeals has waived its rights and remedies with regard to your breach.
            ChakaDeals may still take action or exercise its rights and remedies for that action, or any
            other situation, where you breach your obligations under these Terms of Sale.
           <br> 9.2 Unless otherwise stated within these Terms of Sale, notices to be given to either party
            shall be in writing and shall be delivered by electronic mail (other than if you are sending a
            notice to ChakaDeals for the purpose of legal process) or by pre-paid post. Any notice
            ChakaDeals sends to you will be to the address you supplied to ChakaDeals when you

          <br>  9.3 If any provision of these Terms of Sale should be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
            validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Sale are not
            affected. Such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and
            enforceable provision which most closely achieves the economic effect contemplated by the
            invalid or unenforceable provision.
           <br> 9.4 We will do our best to resolve any disputes about these Terms of Sale. If you wish to
            bring a legal claim against us, you must do so within the United Kingdom (and English courts
            shall have the exclusive jurisdiction for your legal claim). If you live in England and Wales,
            the laws of England shall apply; if you live in Scotland, then Scottish law shall apply; if you
            live in Northern Ireland, then Northern Irish law shall apply. The previous sentence applies
            to all non-contractual relationships between you and us. The parties also agree that the
            United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this
            transaction.
