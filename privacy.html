        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm Gotham-Light text-justify leading-8">
            This Privacy Statement explains how ChakaDeals and our European Affiliates collect, control, process, and
            use information about you (which we call “personal data”). <br> When we say “ChakaDeals”, “us”, “our”, or
            “we”, we mean ChakaDeals. ChakaDeals is the operator of the ChakaDeals marketplace. It provides platforms
            where our UK Affiliates, our EU Affiliates, International Affiliates, and other unaffiliated third-party
            sellers (collectively “Sellers”) can list offers for vouchers, deals, goods, travels, and other offerings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm Gotham-Light text-justify leading-8">
            When we talk about the “Site”, we mean our platforms, which include our websites,
            mobile applications, communications we send or services we provide, social
            networking sites, or any other websites we offer that link to or reference this Privacy
            Statement.
        </p>
        <h3 class="Gotham-Bold text-4xl leading-2">Change</h3>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-8">
            We routinely update this Privacy Statement to clarify our practices and to reflect
            new or different privacy practices, such as when we add new services, functionality,
            or features to the Site. If we make any material changes we will notify you, either by
            email (sent to the email address specified in your account), by means of notice on
            the Site or by using other methods. You can determine when this version of the
            Privacy Statement was adopted by referring to the “Effective Date” above. <br>
            You understand that your continued use of the Site after we send a notice about our
            changes to the Privacy Statement means that the collection, control, processing, and
            use of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Statement. If you object
            to any changes, you may modify your account settings or close your account as
            described below.

        <h3 class="Gotham-Bold text-2xl leading-2">1. Personal Data We Collect</h3>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-7">
            We will collect the following personal data when you interact with the Site:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li>Authentication and identification information (e.g. your name, email address,
                and password). This information is necessary to set up and log you into your
                account, but you do have the option to make purchases without creating a
                password. If you don’t provide this, we may not be able to provide our full
                range of account services to you;</li>
            <li>Basic personal details (e.g. your name, date of birth, and nationality);</li>
            <li>Contact details (e.g. your postal address, telephone number, and email
                address). We may need some of this information to deliver products to you,
                such as your postal address to deliver physical products and your email
                address to send you vouchers, and won’t be able to carry out these services if
                you don’t provide it;</li>
            <li>Payment details (e.g. your credit card details or payment tokens from third
                party payment providers like PayPal). We use these to process your order,
                and won’t be able to take payment from you or give refunds if you don’t
                provide it; and</li>
            <li>With your consent, information about your contacts with ChakaDeals (e.g. call
                recordings, instant messages on our site, and user generated content).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-7">
            Some information we collect is necessary for us to provide our services or meet our
            legal obligations. We will make this clear when we collect that information from you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-7">
            We will also automatically collect personal data when you interact with the Site
            through your computer, mobile device, or other device. This personal data includes
            the following:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li>Analytics data (e.g. information about app downloads, app and web page
                histories), which may include data collected from cookies and other types of
                device identifiers;</li>
            <li>Profile inputs (e.g. page and deal views on the site, purchase details, click
                information and information about the website you clicked to our Site from).
                This may include data about your location. With respect to geolocation
                information collected from your mobile device, we will only collect this where
                you have provided consent; and</li>
            <li>Device details (e.g. MAC address, IP address, bluetooth data and advertising
                identifiers).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-8">
            We also receive personal data and other online and offline information from third
            parties with whom we conduct business, such as merchants, co-marketers,
            distributors, resellers, and other companies or organizations with whom we enter
            into agreements to support our business and operations, including advertising
            partners and third party data providers that provide us with supplemental or
            additional information about our customers (collectively “Business Partners”).
            <br>
            The personal data we receive from Business Partners includes basic personal
            details, contact details, device details, profile inputs, as well as:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li>Demographic information, (e.g. details about age brackets and educational
                background);</li>
            <li>Location data (e.g. information about postal or ZIP code); and</li>
            <li>Purchase information from third party sites (e.g. information about
                purchases on other sites).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify Gotham-Light leading-8">
            We will only receive data from our Business Partners where they are legally
            permitted to share such data, and we will only process that data for the purposes
            described below. We use the data provided to better understand your preferences,
            deals that are relevant to you, and how our merchants are performing. By
            combining the data we collect directly from you with that received from third
            parties, we are able to provide you with a better, and more personalized,
            ChakaDeals experience.
            <br>
            We will collect the personal data described above at various stages in your
            relationship with us when you:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li> Register, subscribe, authorize the transfer of, or create an account with us. If
                you choose not to create a password for your account, we create an account
                and link your purchase details to your email address, which you can set a
                password for during each purchase;</li>
            <li> Open or respond to emails or messages from us;</li>
            <li>Provide information to enroll or participate in programs provided on behalf
                of, or together with Sellers and Business Partners, with your consent or as
                necessary to provide services you have requested;</li>
            <li>Visit any page online that displays our ads or content;</li>
            <li>Purchase products or services on or through the Site from Sellers;</li>
            <li>Connect, log-in, or link to the Site using social networking tools; and</li>
            <li> Post comments to the online communities sections of the Site.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify leading-7 Gotham-Light">
            We also create profiles about you based on the personal data you provide to us or
            that is collected about you, as described above and including personal data that we
            receive from Business Partners. We do this to market offers to you we think you
            would be interested in buying. The contents of that profile include:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li> Account details. For example, we create a permanent URL to your account
                page which may include your name. We also generate tokens to remember your subscription and purchase
                histories, and any loyalty numbers you may
                have obtained;</li>
            <li> Marketing segment information. For example, if you purchase products or
                services related to wellness and beauty, we may infer that you are interested
                in these types of products, or if you purchase ChakaDeals Travels deals we
                may infer that you are a frequent traveler;</li>
            <li>Audience information. We create audiences based on parameters such as
                gender, age, and location (e.g. males aged 25-35 in your city), and if your
                personal data matches those audiences, you’ll be assigned to it. This is to
                help you receive relevant offers; and</li>
            <li>Activity information. Based on your interactions with communications, we’ll
                generate personal data about how many communications you like to receive,
                so that we don’t send you more than are useful to you.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="Gotham-Bold text-2xl leading-2">2. Your Choices</h3>
        <p class="text-justify leading-7 Gotham-Light">
            You can manage the types of personal data you provide to us and can limit how we
            communicate with you. At the same time, we think that the more you tell us about
            yourself and what you like, the more relevant and valuable your experience with our
            Site and services will be.
            <br>
            You can manage your email, push notification, location information and
            subscription notification preferences by logging into your account through the Site
            or by adjusting the settings in our mobile application:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li> Push notifications and location information. Your device and the ChakaDeals
                mobile app provide you with options to control push notifications and how
                and when we collect your geolocation. You can disallow our use of certain
                location data through your device or browser settings, for example, by
                disabling “Location” services for the ChakaDeals application in Apple’s iOS
                and Android privacy settings, or by disabling “Location” services for your
                device;</li>
            <li>Subscriptions. You can also manage your subscriptions by following
                subscription management instructions contained in any commercial emails
                that we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages,
                and may choose not to subscribe to, or to unsubscribe from, others. You may
                update your subscription preferences at any time. Even if you decide not to
                subscribe to, or to unsubscribe, from promotional email messages, we may
                still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your
                purchases from Sellers. For example, even if you have
                unsubscribed from our promotional email messages or push notifications,
                we will still send you confirmations when you make purchases on the Site;</li>
            <li>Cookies. You can manage how your browser handles cookies. You may also
                manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information on
                and about your devices with us, as well as how your mobile browser handles
                cookies;</li>
            <li>Social networking. You may also manage sharing certain personal data with
                us when you connect with us through social networking platforms or
                applications. Please refer to Section 8 below and also the privacy policy and
                settings of the social networking website or application to determine how
                you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between us
                and your social networking account or your mobile device.</li>

        <h3 class="Gotham-Bold text-2xl leading-2">3. Your Rights</h3>
        <p class="text-justify leading-7 Gotham-Light">
            You can access, update, rectify, and delete your personal data which makes up
            some of your profile by logging into your account and clicking on the "Data request"
            button of this privacy policy. Keeping your personal data current helps ensure
            that we can respect your preferences and offer you the goods and services that are
            most relevant to you. <br>
            In accordance with applicable law, you may (i) request access to any personal data
            we hold about you; (ii) request that it be updated, rectified, deleted or blocked; (iii)
            request that we delete personal data we hold about you; (iv) request that we restrict
            our processing of your personal data; and (v) request that we provide you or a third
            party with a copy of certain personal data about you (that is referred to as the right
            of “data portability”); (vi) object to any of our uses of your personal data described in
            this policy, including our marketing activities; <br>
            (vii) revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data, to the extent
            consent was required and provided by you; and (viii) request that we continue to
            process your personal data after we have fulfilled our purposes, if it is necessary to
            complete procedures relating to claiming or defending legal rights, or in connection
            with legal proceedings. <br>
            If you request a correction to your personal information but we do not make that
            correction, you have the right to request that we take attach to your personal
            information a statement that a correction was sought but not made.
            Whilst we will typically comply with any request for you to exercise your data subject
            rights, there may be limited instances where, to the extent required or permitted by
            applicable laws, we will not immediately comply with such requests.

        <h3 class="Gotham-Bold text-2xl leading-2">4. How we Use Information</h3>
        <p class="text-justify leading-7 Gotham-Light">
            We control and process the personal data you provide to us, which we collect from
            other sources, and which we generate to:
        <ul class="Gotham-Light leading-7 text-sm list-disc px-9 text-justify">
            <li> Create your account when you sign up and log you in, which is necessary for
                us to provide our services to you in accordance with the Terms of Use. If you
                make purchases without creating a password, we link these purchases to
                your email address and create a secure account in our systems. If you create
                a password at a later date, you will be able to see the past purchases made
                with a particular email address;</li>

            <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Site by analyzing how you and our other
                customers use and interact with it. This is to meet our legitimate business
                interests in providing the Site and ensuring that it provides the best
                experience for our customers;</li>

            <li>Validate, facilitate, and prevent fraudulent purchases. This may include
                processing orders for vouchers and other goods and services, payment
                verification, and verifying that vouchers redeemed by customers are valid.
                This is necessary to meet our contractual commitments to you set out in the
                Terms of Use;</li>

            <li>Carry-out marketing, which may involve:
                <ol class="list-disc px-4">
                    <li>Establishing and analyzing individual and group profiles and customer
                        behavior, in order to determine your or others interest in certain
                        types of offers, products, and services. We do this by analyzing your
                        interactions with the Site and your other personal data (including

            We encourage our unaffiliated third-party Sellers and Business Partners to adopt

            processing and use of personal data obtained through us and our Affiliate is
            governed by their own privacy policies and practices and is not under our control

            aim to ensure they do not use it for any purposes which are incompatible with those
            set out in this privacy statement.
